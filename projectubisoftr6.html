              From <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-US/company/investor_center/annual_report.aspx">Ubisoft's annual report</a>, the vision for Rainbow Six Siege was to transform it into an eSports game that promotes strategic thinking, cooperation, and diversity.<br><br>

              <ul class="large text-muted">
                <li>Using the <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-ca/game/rainbow-six/siege/game-info/operators">official list</a>, I counted the frequency of each possible role in the game across all of the current operators</li>
                <li>Wanted to create an operator to <b>offer more choices for the currently less frequent roles</b>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Buff, Anti Hard Breech, Hard Breech, Covering Fire, Shield, Trap, Soft Breach, Area Denial</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>I knew that <b>beginners would not have extensive map knowledge</b> such as:
                  <ul>
                    <li>the best spots to place traps</li>
                    <li>key places to breech through</li>

                <li>So this left me with Buff, Covering Fire, and Shield</li>
                <li>I went through player gameplay videos, and found that <b>headshots are common</b>
                  <ul>
                    <li><b>headshots are one-hit kills</b></li>
                    <li>in the case a beginner player experiences this often, could be a <b>potential pain point</b></li>
                    <li>buffs do not prevent headshots</li>
                    <li>covering fire wouldn't protect from snipers</li>
                    <li><b>a shield could prevent headshots</b></li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li class="font-weight-bold">So I decided to choose a shield role for my operator</li>

                <li>I researched the differences between the shields of the current operators:

                          <li>a large shield that covers the whole front of his body at cost of mobility</li>
                          <li>can collapse shield to half size to move faster</li>
                          <li><b>cannot attack while shield is in front</b>, and only has access to a handgun</li>
                        </ul>
                      </li>
                      <li><a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-ca/game/rainbow-six/siege/game-info/operators/blitz">Blitz's</a> shield
                        <ul>
                          <li>a half shield that is always held in front, protecting the front of his head</li>
                          <li><b>when Blitz attacks with his handgun, he moves shield and exposes his head</b></li>
                        </ul>
                      </li>
                      <li><a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-ca/game/rainbow-six/siege/game-info/operators/blackbeard">Blackbeard's</a> shield
                        <ul>
                          <li>shield attachment for his assault rifle, so he <b>can attack while it's protecting his head</b></li>
                          <li>the shield has "HP" so his shield is the only one that can break</li>
                          <li>he currently only has 2 of these attachments</li>
                        </ul>
                      </li>
                      <li><a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-ca/game/rainbow-six/siege/game-info/operators/clash">Clash's</a> shield
                        <ul>
                          <li>a full shield that can slow enemies down in front of her</li>
                          <li><b>can only attack with her handgun/machine pistol when shield is stored on back</b></li>
                        </ul>
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>I wanted to design a shield operator who's both balanced and unique from the other shield operators</li>
                  <li>Since I wanted to <b>help the player from frequently suffering headshots</b>, I wanted to <b>design a shield that allowed the player to attack while it's protecting their head</b></li>
                  <li>The only operator with this capability was <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-ca/game/rainbow-six/siege/game-info/operators/blackbeard">Blackbeard</a>, so I researched him more and found that:
                    <ul>
                      <li>Blackbeard had a history of being unstoppable</li>
                      <li>Resulted in Blackbeard players being more likely to win gunfights</li>
                      <li>His shield previously was able to withstand more hits, so his head stayed protected for longer periods of time while he sprayed the opposing team with his Assault Rifle</li>
                      <li>So the <b>developers had to weaken his shield to make it more fair and balanced</b></li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <div class="text-center col-lg-12">

                  </div>
                  <li>To avoid this past issue, I needed to design this shield in a way where:
                    <ul>
                      <li><b>can't allow aggressive attacks while shield is protecting front part of head</b></li>
                      <li>shield offers some unique capability distinct from Blackbeard's</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li><b>For my shield design, chose to only allow player to attack with shield up when an enemy shoots at their shield</b>, inspired by <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-ca/game/rainbow-six/siege/game-info/operators/wamai">Wamai's</a> special that changes the trajectory of bullets and later found out from a friend that this is a mechanic in Titanfall 2</li>
                  <li><b>also chose to have the shield be transparent from the inside and opaque from the outside</b> made from the same material as <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-ca/game/rainbow-six/siege/game-info/operators/mira">Mira's</a> special bullet-proof glass
                    <ul>
                      <li>allows player to see while shield is in front</li>
                      <li>allows enemies to easily identify the round shield, so they know to be cautious about shooting at it</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li><b>chose to set her secondary weapon as a machine pistol to make up for her lack of independent firepower</b>
                  </li>

                    <li>the Light Reaction Battalion (the former name of the LRR) was referenced in a <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.ca/books/301466/tom-clancys-ghost-recon-by-david-michaels/9780425220146/excerpt">Tom Clancy book</a>

                  <li>Although I did not make it to the end, it was a good opportunity for me to really dive head-first into a game I knew nothing about</li>
                  <li>Went from researching common issues that resulted in a steep barrier of entrance for my target audience to deeply analyzing the abilities and roles of the game’s current operators</li>
                  <li>Learned a lot about what makes Siege such a complex but rewarding game</li>
                  <li>Mentor said that although the passion was there, they wanted me to really push my design to feel more natural for the game. That I barely missed the cut, and didn’t make it in since they couldn’t take on anymore interns</li>
                  <li>It was the first time I took part in a Game Design challenge and first time creating pitch presentations, so it was a great experience nonetheless
