              <h4 class="text-muted">My thought process</h4>
              <ul class="large text-muted">
                <li>Melee combat would require more animations and precise timing</li>
                <li>I thought it would be simpler to take advantage of Unity's physics system</li>
                <li>So for implementing, each projectile would be a Rigidbody (has velocity, gravity, collision) in Unity</li>
                <li>By only adjusting the initial force applied to a single projectile, this would affect both how quickly it travels and how far</li>
                <li>Each projectile can be easily assigned a damage value that subtracts it from an enemy's or player's health on collision</li>
                <li>Inspired by bullet-hell games, multiple projectiles can be fired at once in a specified spread to add another layer</li>
                <li>To allow for easy movement and simple aiming, player shoots projectiles in direction of mouse position and can run simultaneously</li>
                <li class="font-weight-bold">So this became a key part of our combat system</li>
              </ul>
              <h4 class="text-muted">Results</h4>
              <ul class="large text-muted">
                <li>The basic scripts to implement this system only took one work day</li>
                <li>Because of its design, it was simple for us to test and polish</li>

              <ul class="large text-muted">
                <li>For simplicity, I wanted to design 3 different types of characters

                    <li>One tanky character that can easily push forward head-on</li>
                    <li>One sniper-like character that relies on combat from farther away</li>

                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Given the combat system, only needed to adjust numerical values:
                  <ul>
                    <li>character's movement speed</li>
                    <li>percent damage taken from an enemy projectile</li>
                    <li>number of projectiles released in one shot</li>
                    <li>the cooldown time between each shot</li>
                    <li>the damage value assigned to each projectile</li>
                    <li>initial force applied to the projectile rigidbody</li>

                </li>
                <li class="font-weight-bold">So we stuck with this idea</li>

                <li>After implementing the first playable character, adding the two other characters was quick and easy</li>
                <li>My teammates and external playtesters each had different preferred cats to use</li>
                <li>The different cat stats even inspired another teammate design passive abilities for each of them</li>

                  <ul class="large text-muted">
                    <li>Playtesters were curious about the personalities of the characters</li>
                    <li>Wanted to minimize the amount of work that went towards adding story to the game</li>
                    <li>We were in the last two weeks of development, so many features across the game were being tested and polished</li>
                    <li>Needed a way to add in story in a non-intrusive and simple way</li>
                    <li class="font-weight-bold">I suggested having simple dialogue that would play before a level is loaded
                      <ul>
                        <li>was not dependent on how complete a particular level was</li>
                        <li>because of how the levels are set up, it offered spaced-out story bits to players to keep engagement</li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <h4 class="text-muted">Results</h4>
                  <ul class="large text-muted">
                    <li>Gave an opportunity for one of my teammates to gain experience in writing dialogue for the game</li>
                    <li>A place to directly tell players real COVID-19 safety tips</li>
                    <li>Helped to pace and tie the whole game together</li>
